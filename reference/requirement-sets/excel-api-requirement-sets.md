# Excel JavaScript API requirement sets

Requirement sets are named groups of API members. Office Add-ins use requirement sets specified in the manifest or use a runtime check to determine whether an Office host supports APIs that an add-in needs. For more information, see [Specify Office hosts and API requirements](../../docs/overview/specify-office-hosts-and-api-requirements.md).

Excel add-ins run across multiple versions of Office, including Office 2016 for Windows, Office for iPad, Office for Mac, and Office Online. The following table lists the Excel requirement sets, the Office host applications that support that requirement set, and the build versions or number for those applications. 

> **Note**: Any API that is listed as **beta** is not ready for production usage. They are made available so that developers can try them out in test and development environments. They are not meant to be used against production/business critical documents.
